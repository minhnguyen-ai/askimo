/**
 * Generic application error event for errors that do not warrant a dedicated event type.
 *
 * Use this for non-critical, "fire-and-forget" UI errors where no other component needs
 * to react programmatically. The [title] and [message] are already-resolved strings so
 * that [shared] stays free of any UI/i18n dependency — resolution happens at the call site.
 *
 * For errors that significantly impact UX flow (e.g. model unavailable, send failure),
 * prefer a dedicated event type so that other components can react specifically.
 *
 * @param title Short, user-facing title for the error dialog.
 * @param message Detailed, user-facing description of what went wrong.
 * @param cause Optional underlying throwable, used for debug logging only.
