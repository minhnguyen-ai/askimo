/**
 * Describes the execution topology of a plan as a tree of nodes.
 *
 * This is a pure data structure — it carries no LangChain4j types so it can be
 * serialised to/from YAML and stored independently of the AI runtime.
 *
 * The tree is evaluated recursively at execution time by `PlanWorkflowBuilder`,
 * which maps each node to the corresponding `AgenticServices` builder:
 *
 * - [Step]        → a single `UntypedAgent` wrapping one [PlanStep]
 * - [Ask]         → interactive pause: user is prompted for input, answer stored in scope
 * - [Sequence]    → `AgenticServices.sequenceBuilder()`
 * - [Parallel]    → `AgenticServices.parallelBuilder()`
 * - [Conditional] → `AgenticServices.conditionalBuilder()`
