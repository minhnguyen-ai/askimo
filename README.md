## Core Capabilities

Askimo brings together the power of AI models, the convenience of a native desktop experience, and the flexibility of a command line tool. Whether you are chatting, automating tasks, or working within a project, Askimo is built to fit the way you work.

### Unified AI Chat
Work with multiple AI providers in one place. Askimo keeps your entire conversation history available locally, with rich formatting, code highlighting, image support, provider switching, and fast full-text search. You can star important chats, organize your work, and export conversations when needed.

### Knowledge and Project Intelligence
Askimo CLI includes RAG-enabled project workspaces. It indexes your files, documentation, and code so AI responses include real project context. Backed by PostgreSQL and pgvector for reliable vector search.

### Automation and Terminal Workflows
Pipe logs, files, or command output directly into Askimo, or run prompts in non-interactive mode for CI pipelines. Recipes let you build reusable workflows for code review, documentation, summarization, and more.

### Flexible, Extensible Platform
Use any provider, add your own integrations, or extend Askimo with custom commands and models. Both Desktop and CLI follow a local-first approach for privacy and data control.
